## What’s This About?

This repository contains projects that apply blockchain concepts in real-world scenarios. You'll find:

- Projects built using **Solidity**, **Hyperledger Fabric**, and **Golang**
- Applications of **decentralized identity**, **smart contracts**, and **blockchain-based manufacturing**
- Research insights into blockchain's use in **supply chains**, **cybersecurity**, and **governance**

## What's Inside?

### Engineering Blockchain Projects

- **ERC-721 Smart Contract** – Created and deployed a non-fungible token (NFT) contract on an Ethereum-based network.
- **Hyperledger Fabric Network** – Built a private permissioned blockchain using Hyperledger, demonstrating business logic and data flow via chaincodes.
