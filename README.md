# Blockchain Engineering Lab

Welcome to my portfolio of work for **CSE 598: Engineering Blockchain Applications** at Arizona State University. This repository showcases hands-on projects and research conducted during my graduate coursework and independent exploration in blockchain technology.

---

## What’s This About?

This repository contains projects that apply blockchain concepts in real-world scenarios. You'll find:

- Projects built using **Solidity**, **Hyperledger Fabric**, and **Golang**
- Applications of **decentralized identity**, **smart contracts**, and **blockchain-based manufacturing**
- Research insights into blockchain's use in **supply chains**, **cybersecurity**, and **governance**

---

## What's Inside?

### Engineering Blockchain Projects

- **ERC-721 Smart Contract** – Created and deployed a non-fungible token (NFT) contract on an Ethereum-based network.
- **Hyperledger Fabric Network** – Built a private permissioned blockchain using Hyperledger, demonstrating business logic and data flow via chaincodes.

### Blockchain Research Area Exploration (Optional Project)

- Explored how blockchain can transform cloud manufacturing.
- Proposed a **Decentralized Cloud Manufacturing-as-a-Service (CMaaS)** platform.
- Integrated concepts like **Digital Twin technology**, **AI/ML for quality control**, and **Blockchain for data provenance**.

### Quizzes & Coursework

- Practice quizzes and notes covering:
  - Blockchain abstractions
  - Consensus mechanisms
  - Transactions and mining
  - Cryptographic foundations
